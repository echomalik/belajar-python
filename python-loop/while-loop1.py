# while - loop

number = 1

# we have to use condition checking
# like what we did in if-condition

# check if number is less than 10
while number < 10:
	print("I like python!")
	number += 1

# number is always added by 1
# to reach the maximum value (condition)
# so it will stop when number value is 10
